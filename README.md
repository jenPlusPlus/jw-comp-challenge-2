Turing School FEE 1706 Mod 1 Static Comp 2

## Overview
I enjoyed this static comp, other than doing the responsiveness aspect. The card layout was very straightforward to set up. I still struggle quite a bit with positioning, so making the site responsive proved to be a challenge. I got the site to look good on mobile, but I was not able to make it fully responsive. CSS is an area of growth for me, and I plan to continue practicing.
